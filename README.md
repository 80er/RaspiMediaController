# RaspiMediaController
Did not find a better name for it for now. Suggestions welcome. So what do i do here. I build some sort of a radio (DAB+/Kodi/Whatever mediacenter) using a Raspberry PI. To increase the WAF (Wife Acceptance Factor) I need some utilities/software on the Raspi to make usage of the thing easier. And also i want to learn some stuff about .NET Core, Raspi, ... So maybe sometimes the solutions may seem overengineered ;)
